# React Web Component Injector

React Web Component Injector provides a way to utilise your React components in a similar way to web components. It works by injecting your custom React components into their corresponding custom html components on the page and then letting React take over from there as usual. This provides a slightly different approach to rendering a React app over the more conventional way of defining a single root component on the page that renders the entire app.
